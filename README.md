# DistilBERT-DeNiro ðŸ¤— Model Card
See the relevant [ðŸ¤— Model Card](https://huggingface.co/MarioBarbeque/DistilBERT-DeNiro) for this masked language model that I fine-tuned atop the DistilBERT checkpoint for the purpose of cinema domain-adaptation.
The preprocessing and training code is available in the `DistilBERT-DeNiro.ipynb` file.
